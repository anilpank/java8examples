Examples of what java 8 has to offer

# Collections
To see what can be done in Collections, please review org.anon.CollectionExamples.java class. There I have covered various examples on how to iterate, manipulate, join, filter ,pick elements and do all sort of operations on Lists using Java Lambdas.

# Comparators
In class org.anon.ComparatorExamples.java, I have demonstrated how we can do various comparisions without writing anonymous inner classes. With lambdas, we can do ascending, descending, compare objects by different fields, grouping, multi level grouping and the list goes on.

# Files
In class org.anon.FileExamples.java, I have demonstrated power of lambda to do file listing, sub directory listing, getting hidden files, selecting files, watching file changes and so on.

# Lambda Design Patterns
In class org.anon.LambdaDesigns.java, I would be exploring the design patterns that we could use to make our Java code better. This is work in progress.

# Future
This project is open for contribution, if you can do something cool in Java 8, please fork and then create a pull request. I'll merge those changes here. A lot is at stake here. We need to compete with Scala, Pun Intended. :)
